title: Components of PEER
---
The participants of an open access publication platform can be divided into three different groups. The so-called students submit their thesis and wait for it to be published on the platform, provided that quality standards are met. The examiner ensures precisely these quality standards in which he corrects and evaluates the student's thesis. The last group consists of the lurker, who only passively browses the submissions, for example, to gain knowledge. Therefore three main views are needed: The student needs to submit a thesis, the examiner needs to correct said thesis, and the lurker needs a view to browse published submissions.
As soon as you have opened the website, the front page opens. Here you have access to all the functions of the PEER platform.
The most important features are the "Discover" feature, which allows you to search for other publications, and the "Submit Your Thesis" button, which allows you to submit your publications or theses to PEER. PEER also offers the possibility to update the thesis ("Update Your Thesis") and to check the current evaluation status ("Check Your Thesis").

The individual functions are briefly presented below:

## Discover

The "Discover" function offers visitors to the PEER website the opportunity to discover new publications. On the one hand, they can search independently for works that they need for their own research to acquire knowledge, or on the other hand they can have suggested topics displayed. 

Currently, due to testing purposes, all submitted works are displayed in the Discover window. In the actual implementation, however, only papers verified by the Examiner will be published in Discovery.

## Submit Your Thesis

One of the most important functions of PEER is the submission of your own scientific work. "Submit Your Thesis" takes you to a page where you can submit your paper.

In the first step, you can enter your personal data such as your name, email and ethereum address.

After entering your own details, the next step is to enter the examiner's data. Here, data such as the name of the examiner, his or her email, the name of the institute and his or her ehterum address are also entered

After entering the personal data and the data of the examiner, the details of the thesis can be entered in the next step.

In the last step, the student can upload their actual thesis on the left. Furthermore, he has the possibility to submit additional Zip files via the right field.

PEER only allows the submitter to change the email afterwards. This is because it is important that the persons involved can also contact each other later. Errors in names or other information cannot be changed later for reasons of protection against manipulation.

## Check Your Thesis

In addition to uploading new publications, you can also check the current status of the correction of the work.

You can view the status of your own work and see whether it has already been corrected and you can also view the status of the publications assigned to you.

## Update Your Thesis

On the same field  like the Correction Status of the publication, the submitter also has the option there of updating his publication. The submitter can update both the actual work and additional files. PEER offers the possibility to save both the original document and the new version in the blockchain.

## Correcting Submissions

In addition to submitting submissions, PEER also offers the possibility of directly correcting and accepting the submitted theses. The examiner entered in the "Submit Your Thesis" process can use PEER to evaluate the theses assigned to him/her in three steps.

In the first step, the assessor can accept the thesis if he is the correct supervisor of the thesis. If he confirms this, he can confirm the end of the process in the second step, after correction. In the last step, the examiner also has the opportunity to verify the work and thus confirm that the submitted work conforms to scientific standards.

The Examiner can change the respective status via the "Change State" field. With the help of the file field, the examiner gets direct access to the submission provided.

title: Components of PEER for Examiner
---

## Correcting Submissions

In addition to submitting submissions, PEER also offers the possibility of directly correcting and accepting the submitted theses. The examiner entered in the "Submit Your Thesis" process can use PEER to evaluate the theses assigned to him/her in three steps.

In the first step, the assessor can accept the thesis if he is the correct supervisor of the thesis. If he confirms this, he can confirm the end of the process in the second step, after correction. In the last step, the examiner also has the opportunity to verify the work and thus confirm that the submitted work conforms to scientific standards.

The Examiner can change the respective status via the "Change State" field. With the help of the file field, the examiner gets direct access to the submission provided.

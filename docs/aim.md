title: Goal of PEER
---

Every year, around 500,000 theses are submitted by students in Germany alone. Unfortunately, most of the knowledge of these theses disappears in non-public university archives or desk drawers. But student dissertations are valuable knowledge sources
because they are often thoroughly researched and written, deal with very current and important topics and can offer great scientific added value. 

Overall goal of the platform is to increase the usefulness and impact of top-graded student dissertations.
In addition to this main objective, PEER pursues other important goals:

- Fast and effective publication process that ensures content excellence
- Openness and transparency regarding stored data and processes
- High integrity of data and processes
- High system availability and scalability

As a result of the above objectives, the requirements for PEER were defined with the help of a stakeholder interview. These are subdivided into functional and non-functional requirements and were defined and assigned with the support of the work by Balzert (2010, p.455 - 480) & Sunyaev (2020, p.51 - 65)

## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements for the system are:

- Searching for published and verified publications on PEER ("Discover")
- Ability to submit your own publication ("Submit Your Thesis")
- Possibility to check the evaluation status ("Check Your Thesis")
- Opportunity to update thesis ("Update Your Thesis")
- Correction and evaluation of publications ("Correcting submissions")
- Change personal data

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-Functional requirements for the system are:

- User-friendly frontend
- Write smart contracts as efficiently as possible to reduce transaction costs
- Functionality should also be possible without the use of a frontend

With the help of the derived requirements for PEER, a project architecture was developed and the individual procedures of the requirements were mapped in processes (see Resume and further Information - Further Information).
